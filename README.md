# HackerNews

A .NET MAUI app for displaying the top posts on Hacker News.

This app demonstrates how to use IAsyncEnumerable + C# 8.0 to improve performance. Thanks to IAsyncEnumerable, the items are added to the list as soon as they're available making the app feel faster and more responsive.

This app also uses the Firebase Realtime Database REST API.
